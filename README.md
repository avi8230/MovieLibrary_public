# Movie Library Project

I built this project to practice working with JavaScript, particularly in collaboration with a remote server, and to gain experience with `localStorage`.

## Project Overview

This project is a Movie Library where users can explore and manage their favorite movies. The application allows interaction with a remote server to fetch and display movie information. It also utilizes `localStorage` for a seamless user experience by storing relevant data locally.
